# GitHub-Bootcamp

## Get Started (Davron)

1. Clone the Project

- [**Git Guide**](/git.md)

        git clone https://github.com/davronaliyev/GitHub-Bootcamp.git
        
2. Create new Branch

        git checkout -b yourName

3. Fix the Code

        - Open index.html
        - Then update baseImage.png to your task.png
                src="src/img/baseImage.png">
                src="src/img/task1.png"> 

4. Commit and Push your changes

        git add .
        git commit -m "Task 1 fix"
        git push

5. Create Pull request (from your branch to main branch)


## GitHub Workflows aka Actions (Kumarapillai, Govindaraj)

1.  Actions <br /> 
       actions are event driven ( push, commit, etc) [Events that trigger workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows)<br />

2. Creating your first workflow <br />
      workflows are written in yaml. usually stored in ```./github/workflows``` directory 
      ```yaml
         name: GitHub Actions Demo
             on: [push]
               jobs:
                 job 1:
                   runs-on: on-prem
                     steps:
                       'do something' 
    ```
    
3. Let's Break down <br />

  ````name : GitHub Actions Demo```` Optional - The name of the workflow as it will appear in the Actions tab of the GitHub repository.
 ***            
  ````on: [push]```` Specifies the trigger for this workflow. This example uses the push event, so a workflow run is triggered every time someone pushes a change to the repository or merges a pull request. This is triggered by a push to every branch
 ***
  ````jobs:```` Groups together all the jobs runs in the workflow
 ***
  ````job1```` Job name
 ***
  ````runs-on: on-prem```` Configures the job to run on the on-prem Linux runner. we can also configure to run on multi-platform and dind runners
 ***
  ````steps```` Groups together all the steps that run in the job  
## Advance Workflows & Continuous Integration (Perumal, thiYag)

1. Functions

2. Continuous Integration

3. Environment variables

4. Encrypted variables

5. Strategy and matrix

6. Containers in jobs

7. Trigger jobs using GitHub API

8. Custom GitHub actions - Docker container , JavaScript and Composite Actions

9. GitHub Selfhosted Runners
